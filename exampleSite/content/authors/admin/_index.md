I am an Associate Professor of Finance and Canada Research Chair in Financial Technology at the University of Calgary's Haskayne School of Business. I am also an Academic Fellow of the Institut Louis Bachelier in Paris.

My research sits at the intersection of technology and finance, where I use experimental methods and game theory to decode how digital trading, AI, and decentralized finance fundamentally transform market dynamics and investor psychology. My work appeared in leading academic journals, including *The Review of Financial Studies*, *Management Science*, *Journal of Financial Markets*, and *Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance*.
